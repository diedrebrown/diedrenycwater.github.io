Repository for Data Visualization and Information Aesthetics Class Project Fall 2016

This project looks at who and what are affected by coastal loss to Brooklyn's Community District #6 Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Columbia Street, Gowanus, Park Slope, and Red Hook.

By looking at what is the extent of loss of coastal area to NYC based on the data from the FEMA maps, I'd like to show the variation between the 2020 and 2050 predictions, as well as, how an area that was heavily affected by Sandy, like BKLYN CD6, will fare based on these predictions to the rest of the city.
