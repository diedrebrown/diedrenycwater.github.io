 		<p>By looking at what is the extent of loss of coastal area to NYC based on the data from the FEMA maps,  the variation between the 2020 and 2050 predictions, as well as, how an area that was heavily affected by Sandy, like BKLYN CD6, will fare based on these predictions to the rest of the city.</p>
