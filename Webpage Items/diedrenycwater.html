	<p>New York is a city where one is surrounded by water, but one rarely interacts or notices it outside of a rain event or news article on sea level rise.</p>
	<p>As Robert Proctor stated in the Opinion Pages of the New York Times, we have entered into an age of information that is better described as "the age of ignorance." While there are some that believe that climate change is a hoax, in order to create a more resilient future, adaptation measures must be adopted to reduce associated ecological impacts and costs.</p>

		<p>This project looks at who and what are affected by coastal loss to Brooklyn's Community District #6 Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Columbia Street, Gowanus, Park Slope, and Red Hook.</p>
 		<p>By looking at what is the extent of loss of coastal area to NYC based on the data from the FEMA maps,  the variation between the 2020 and 2050 predictions, as well as, how an area that was heavily affected by Sandy, like BKLYN CD6, will fare based on these predictions to the rest of the city.</p>

	<p>All of the five boroughs of New York City have a coastal edge. By finding the area of water within each borough's boundary, potential flooding zones start to emerge.</p>
