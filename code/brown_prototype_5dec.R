####AIMS####
#Who and what are affected by coastal loss to Brooklyn's CD 6 Carroll Gardens, 
#Cobble Hill, Columbia St., Gowanus, Park Slope, Red Hook
#Looking at what is the extent of loss of coastal area to NYC based on the data from the FEMA maps,
#Iâ€™d like to express it as a series of small multiples over maps and/or charts.
#How does the area of the 2050 predictions vary from the 2020 predictions?
#In the city as a whole.
#2020 100 year to 500 year
#2050 100 year to 500 year
#2020 100 year to 2050 100 year
#2050 100 year to 2050 500 year
#For a coastal area heavily affected by Sandy, like Brooklyn's Community District 6, based on these predictions,
#how does the community compare to the rest of the city?
#2020 100 year to 500 year
#2050 100 year to 500 year
#2020 100 year to 2050 100 year
#2050 100 year to 2050 500 year
